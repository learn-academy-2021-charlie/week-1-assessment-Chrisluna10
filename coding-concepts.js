// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Charlie 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 12
// b) Verify and explain: The answer is 12 because the property .length returns the length of the string.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer:l
// b) Verify and explain: The answer was correct because having a number inside the brackets returns the third index which in this case is the fourth letter because of the zero index.


// --------------------3) What will this log?

var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby
// b) Verify and explain: The answer was Ruby because the variable "index" is asking for the first word which is technically the second word because "Javascript" is the second word.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: Saturday, Sunday
// b) Verify and explain: There was an error because you can not use the uppercase function on a variable. 


// --------------------5) What will this log?

var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: number
// b) Verify and explain: Since dataTypes.length is returning a number, typeof recognizes that as a number and this function returns what type of datatype is next to it.
