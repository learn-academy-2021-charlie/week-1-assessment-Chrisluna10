# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a statement that performs a task. After the task is performed an output is recieved. This would be used when a specific code is needed to be executed multiple times.

  Researched answer: Functions are a reusable piece of code that always return an output only when executed. Functions are used to define a block of code and execute as many times as you want. 



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder inside of a function while an argument is the actual value inputed into the function.

  Researched answer: Parameters are local variables which are assigned value of the arguments when the function is called.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the placement of a character within a string. The value is the information that is used in code. 

  Researched answer: strings have a length property and each character in the string can be accounted for by its placement called an index



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is an integrated function that can be easily accessed by typing part of the name. This allows for quicker use of an action. 

  Researched answer: To keep us from reinventing the wheel, the JavaScript language has a bunch of pre-made functionality that can be used on the data type string. These are called built-in methods. The built-in methods often rely on properties that are innate to the data type of string.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming requires only one person to be coding at a time while the other person provides information such as questions, corrections and code to input while watching the other person code. The two programmers are also switching frequently in order to have adequete breaks from one role. The person that is coding is called the driver while the person observing and managing is called the navigator. 

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The weekly retrospective was very helpful because everyone was sharing their strengths and weaknesses. This helped me relate to others and show that we are in the same boat when it comes to progress and knowledge on the subjects taught to us. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: A process wherein a set of instructions or structures are repeated in a sequence a specified number of times or until a condition is met.

2. Higher Order Functions: A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

3. Jest: Jest is a library for testing JavaScript code.

4. Classes: A JavaScript class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data.

5. React: React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.
